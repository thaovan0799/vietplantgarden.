	      <p><h5>How we consume the web changes how we design websites. Mobile devices and the trend towards responsive design push designers to find ways to maximize web experiences for everyone, no matter what device(s) they’re using.</h5></p><br>
	<p>While designers have played an important role, they’ve been more behind the scenes. Designers have always been at odds with the web development workflow, hindered by limited tools and slow-moving standards.</p><br>
	
	<p>The next 25 years of the web will be all about design. We can make significantly more progress by opening up the power of web development to the masses. Similar to how desktop software once transformed print design, or how blogging services have revolutionized the publishing landscape, a more powerful web design software can completely change how we create for the web.</p> <br>
	
	<h5>The progress paradox</h5><br>
	
	<p>When I first got into web design in 1999, it only took a few months of playing with Dreamweaver to learn the majority of the web designer’s toolkit. Almost immediately, I felt empowered and started taking on real projects for real businesses that paid me real money.</p><br>
	
	<p>Getting into web design today, however, is an entirely different challenge. While browsers have become more standardized and predictable, the learning curve for developing for them is steeper than ever. HTML and CSS have expanded significantly in scope, and JavaScript has become a much more vital component of most websites and applications.</p>
	
	<img src="Images/BLOG_1920/1.jpg" alt=" " class="w-100">
	<p>The walk signal button is just one of the many microinteractions we encounter daily.</p><br>
	
	<p>Although we’ve had many frameworks and tools built around the web design workflow, nearly all of them remain code-based and require a level of comfort with text editors that most designers don’t have. The sheer number of frameworks leads beginners towards a paradox of choice, causing many to give up before understanding the fundamentals.</p><br>
	
	<h5>The progress paradox</h5><br>
	
	<p>Despite the growing complexity of web development, there has been almost zero progress made in visual web design tools over the last 10 years. All of the momentum behind Dreamweaver seems to have been killed by the Adobe acquisition, and most new tools that have emerged have been based on writing code. It seems that code has provided a nice crutch, as if we have admitted as an industry that it’s the only serious way we can create for the web.</p><br>
	
	<p>But why should we settle for hand-written code as being the only ‘proper’ solution? For decades already, graphic designers have had tools like Photoshop and Illustrator to work in their medium and rid them of Bézier math and arcane details of physical typesetting. Print designers have access to visual desktop publishing software like InDesign. 3D artists have modeling and animation software that they can manipulate directly. And yet, web designers are stuck with two suboptimal choices: either learn to code or rely on programmers to translate designs to a working solution. This is completely broken!</p><br>
